        # Quite often, a sequence is meant to implement a higher-level
        # functionality. In this case, it is better to not use a Sequence task
        # at all, but instead create the sequence as dependency of a high-level
        # task instance.
        #
        # #to_task transfers the underlying sequence to the task given as
        # argument. If +task+ is a task model instead of a task instance, it
        # first creates a new instance of this model and returns it.
        #
        # For instance:
        #   
        #   seq = (Sequence.new <<
        #       GoTo.new(:target => a) <<
        #       Pickup.new(:object => b) <<
        #       GoTo.new(:target => c)
        #
        #   mission = GetObject.new(:object => b)
        #   seq.child_of(mission)
        #
