        # == About job management
        # One of the tasks of this class is to do job management. Jobs are the
        # unit that is used to interact with a running Roby instance at a high
        # level, as e.g. through a shell or a GUI. In Roby, jobs are represented
        # by tasks that provide the {Job} task service and have a
        # non-nil job ID. Up to two tasks can be associated with the job. The
        # first is obviously the job task itself, i.e. the task that provides
        # {Job}. Quite often, the job task will be a planning task
        # (actually, one can see that {Actions::Task} provides
        # {Job}). In this case, the planned task will be also
        # associated with the job as its placeholder: while the job task
        # represents the job's deployment status, the placeholder task will
        # represent the job's execution status.
