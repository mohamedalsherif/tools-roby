            # This class provides an asynchronous (event-based) API to the Roby
            # interface, it allows for job and task discovery and tracking, and
            # is robust to disconnections and reconnections.
            #
            # It is meant for the implementations of GUIs that interface with a
            # Roby system. The {#poll} method must be called regularly from a
            # main event loop (e.g. from a Qt timer)
            #
            # Notification callbacks can be registered with one of the on_
            # methods (on_job, ...). A Qt-oriented declarative approach to
            # binding jobs to a UI can be found in {UIConnector}
