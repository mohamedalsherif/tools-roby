    # Relation graphs are managed in hierarchies (for instance, in
    # EventStructure, Precedence is a superset of CausalLink, and CausalLink a
    # superset of both Forwarding and Signal). In this hierarchy, at each
    # level, an edge cannot be present in more than one graph. Nonetheless, it
    # is possible for a parent relation to have an edge which is present in
    # none of its children.
    #
    # Each relation define two things:
    # * a graph, which is represented by the RelationGraph instance itself
    # * support methods that are defined on the vertices of the relation. They 
    #   allow to manage the vertex in its relations easily. Those methods are
    #   defined in a separate module (see {#support})
    #
    # In general, relations are part of a RelationSpace instance, which manages
    # the set of relations whose vertices are of the same kind (for instance
    # TaskStructure manages all relations whose vertices are Task instances).
    # In these cases, RelationSpace#relation allow to define new relations easily.

	# child_name::
	#   define a <tt>each_#{child_name}</tt> method to iterate
	#   on the vertex children. Uses the relation name by default (a Child
	#   relation would define a <tt>each_child</tt> method)
	# parent_name::
	#   define a <tt>each_#{parent_name}</tt> method to iterate
	#   on the parent vertices. If none is given, no method is defined.
	# subsets:: a list of subgraphs. See RelationGraph#superset_of [empty set by default]
	# noinfo::
	#   wether the relation embeds some additional information. If false,
	#   the child iterator method (<tt>each_#{child_name}</tt>) will yield (child,
	#   info) instead of only child [false by default]
	# graph:: the relation graph class [RelationGraph by default]
	# distribute:: if true, the relation can be seen by remote peers [true by default]
	# single_child::
        #   if the relations accepts only one child per vertex. If this option
        #   is set, defines a <tt>#{child_name}</tt> method which returns the
        #   only child (or nil if there is no child at all) [false by default]
        # dag::
        #   if true, CycleFoundError will be raised if a new vertex would
        #   create a cycle in this relation [true by default]
        # weak::
        #   marks that this relation might be broken by the plan manager if
        #   needs be. This is currently only used in the garbage collection
        #   phase to decide in which order to GC the tasks. I.e. if a cycle is
        #   found, the weak relations will be broken to resolve it.
        # strong::
        #   marks that the tasks that are linked by this relation should not be
        #   torn apart. This is for instance used in the replacement operation,
        #   which will never "move" a relation from the original task to the
        #   replaced one.
        #
        # For instance,
        #   relation :Children
        #
        # defines an instance of RelationGraph which is a DAG, defining the
        # following methods on its vertices:
        #   each_children { |v, info| ... } => graph
        #   find_children { |v, info| ... } => object or nil
        #   add_children(v, info = nil) => graph
        #   remove_children(v) => graph
        #
        # and
        #
        #   relation :Children, :child_name => :child
        #
        # would define
        #
        #   each_child { |v, info| ... } => graph
        #   find_child { |v, info| ... } => object or nil
        #   add_child(v, info = nil) => graph
        #   remove_child(v) => graph
        #
        # * the DirectedRelationSupport module gets included in the vertex classes at the
        #   construction of the RelationSpace instance. See #apply_on.
        # * the <tt>:noinfo</tt> option would then remove the 'info' parameter
        #   to the various blocks.
        # * if <tt>:single_child</tt> is set to true, then an additional method is defined:
        #     child => object or nil
        # * and finally if the following is used
        #     relation :Children, :child_name => :child, :parent_name => :parent
        #   then the following method is additionally defined
        #     each_parent { |v| ... }
